# Features to add in the next version
## Basic features 
-a start/stop simulation button , because now the simulation is ever continious (i've hosted it on render and the server IS permanently sending data and working ).

-the ability to turn left or right at an intersection ( now the car just goes straight all the time and that's very limited) , perhaps adding a roundabout too.



-fix the accident counter because it goes to a certain number once a state is in action ( for instance , when we're in a state the counter is 16 , after that state , the counter is 42 , the accidents seem to be "preloaded" and not calculated in real time , which is not good for the simulation accuracy).

-in the current map , the plot of green land is not sterched to the scene , and the asphaulted road is not even reaching the green land so it's scene>green land>road 

## advanced feature to add

-the ability to choose multiple maps , have a side bar to choose from different maps (correct my idea but when selecting the other map , we do a "loading screen" to free up ressources and load the new map and thus "deleting" the memory used by the previous map).
