Always assume that both the frontend and backend servers are executed ,unless explicitly stated otherwise.

the traffic.py file is the backend server code written in Python.
the src/ThreeScene.jsx file is the frontend code written in JavaScript using React and Three
both files are the server files , so don't try to execute them in the terminal
